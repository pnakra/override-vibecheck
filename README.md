# Vibe Check — Interpersonal Safety & Consent (Exploratory)

Vibe Check is an exploratory AI project focused on helping people interpret ambiguous, coercive, or harmful interpersonal situations — particularly in contexts involving sexual pressure, power imbalance, or unclear consent.

This work emerged from the gap between how people experience harm in real life and how poorly existing language, tools, and systems capture that experience.

## What this project explores
- How coercion and pressure often appear indirectly rather than explicitly
- The language patterns people use when describing uncomfortable or unsafe interactions
- Ways AI can help translate “something felt wrong” into clearer understanding

## What exists in this repository
- Prompt experiments for analyzing interpersonal scenarios
- Example inputs and structured outputs
- Product and safety framing notes

## What this is not
- This is not a diagnostic or legal tool
- This is not a replacement for professional support
- This repository documents exploratory work only

## Why this work matters
Many people struggle to name harm when it doesn’t match stereotypes or legal definitions.
Tools that help people reason about consent, pressure, and boundaries can support clarity, agency, and safer decision-making.

## Status
Ongoing independent research and product exploration.
